Description: XPU container runtime library
 The xpu-container library provides an interface to configure GNU/Linux
 containers leveraging XPU hardware. The implementation relies on several
 kernel subsystems and is designed to be agnostic of the container runtime.
 .
 This package requires the XPU driver (>= 340.29) to be installed separately.
